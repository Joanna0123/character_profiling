I will give you the summary of a book and a character's name in this book. Your task is to read the summary and design at least 5 multiple-choice questions about this character. For each question, you should identify a significant decision the character made and ask why does the character make this decision. You should give four options for each question and only one is the correct answer. The correct answer is the character's motivation of making this decision mentioned in this book. You need to design the other three options. These wrong options should be reasonable but not completely consistent with the character's personality, past experiences or social relationships mentioned in the book. For each option, you should explain why it is correct based on the character's personality, past experiences and social relationships or why it is not the best choice compared to the correct answer. The output should be in json format.
